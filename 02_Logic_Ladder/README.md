## ðŸ§  Logic Ladder Programs

### 1. Palindrome Number Checker
- ðŸ”¹ **Idea**: A number is a palindrome if it reads the same forward and backward (e.g., 121).
- ðŸ”¹ **Concepts**: Loops, reversing numbers, condition check.
- ðŸ”¹ **Why**: Combines digit operations with logic.

---

### 2. Prime Numbers Between 1 to 100
- ðŸ”¹ **Idea**: Print numbers that are only divisible by 1 and itself.
- ðŸ”¹ **Concepts**: Nested loops, modulus operator, break.
- ðŸ”¹ **Why**: Strengthens nested loop logic and condition checking.

---

### 3. Reverse Digits of a Number
- ðŸ”¹ **Idea**: Use % to get the last digit and // to remove it until number becomes 0.
- ðŸ”¹ **Concepts**: Loop, digit extraction, number manipulation.
- ðŸ”¹ **Why**: Common logic used in many competitive problems.

---

### 4. Sum of Digits of a Number
- ðŸ”¹ **Idea**: Add all digits by extracting them using % 10 and removing using // 10.
- ðŸ”¹ **Concepts**: Loop, digit operations, accumulator.
- ðŸ”¹ **Why**: Reinforces number traversal and math basics.

---

### 5. Count Vowels in a String
- ðŸ”¹ **Idea**: Loop through each character in a string and check if itâ€™s a vowel (a, e, i, o, u).
- ðŸ”¹ **Concepts**: String traversal, character checking, `.lower()`, `in`.
- ðŸ”¹ **Why**: Introduces string operations and membership operators.

---

### 6. Find Factorial using While Loop
- ðŸ”¹ **Idea**: Multiply numbers from 1 to N (fact = fact * i).
- ðŸ”¹ **Concepts**: Looping, accumulator variable.
- ðŸ”¹ **Why**: Essential for recursion, combinatorics, and DSA later.
